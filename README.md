# ES6 module interface library

**This project is experimental.**

there is many virtual DOM framework actually 55 pages on npm. What is a virtual dom ? React vuejs and angular are
virtual dom libraries.

**Why write yet another lib ?**

I really love angular and I work with it every days, React and vuejs are awesome. I just want something different, and
push my skills forward.

- I dont want to wait for a build any time I do a change
- I want an eventBus wich can send events to any parent/child/sibling/id with ne line of code
- I want any library dependencies
- I want a small size and fast loading
